    <h3> Element learning: a systematic approach of accelerating finite element-type methods via machine learning</h4>
    <p> My research interests in this area center around the consideration of the following two closely related questions:
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of classical numerical methods (e.g. finite
    element) and machine learning based methods?
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. How to combine their advantages?
    </p>

    <p> Thinking about the above two questions has led to a recent discovery of a new computational
    framework which we call element learning. This new approach can be used to systematically
    accelerate finite element-type methods through machine learning while still retaining
    the many advantages of classical finite element-type methods, such as proficient handling
    of complex geometry and boundary conditions, reliability, and many more. See the following
    figure for a visual explanation of the core idea of element learning.
    </p>

    <p> Our numerical results for radiative transfer equation show that element learning can
    generally achieve at least 5-10 times speed-up compared to a classical finite element-type
    method while retaining the same accuracy requirement. We refer to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02467" target="_blank"> arXiv:2308.02467 </a>
    for more detail on our discovery.

    <h3> Adaptive-mesh inversion: a goal-oriented hp-adaptive mesh refinement method for solving inverse radiative transfer problems</h4>
    <p> Inverse radiative transfer serves as the mathematical foundation for a wide spectrum of applications such as optical tomography and remote sensing.
    Despite its broad applications, devising numerical methods for inverse radiative transfer
    is notoriously challenging due to the high-dimensional nature of the forward
    problem. Standard discretizations that meet the accuracy standards often demand significant
    memory resources, making the solver inefficient and sometimes impractical. This challenge
    amplifies in the inverse problem scenario, where numerous iterations of the forward
    problems are necessary. As such, there's a pressing need to design numerical methods that
    are memory-efficient and have fewer degrees of freedom (DOFs) without compromising on
    accuracy. </p>

    <p> To address the challenges previously mentioned, we introduced the so called adaptive-mesh
    inversion method. This is a goal-oriented hp-adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique tailored
    for solving inverse problems. A distinctive feature of the approach is the integration of
    two optimization processes: one for inversion and the other for mesh adaptivity. By leveraging
    the connections between duality-based mesh adaptivity and adjoint-based inversion
    techniques, we are able to devise a goal-oriented error estimator. This estimator is cost effective
    to compute. The numerical tests suggest it can efficiently steer mesh-refinement to
    effectively address the inverse radiative transfer problem.
    The main idea of the methodology can be visually represented as in the following figure. </p>

    <h3> Symplectic Hamiltonian finite element methods for electromagnetics</h4>
    <p> Symplectic Hamiltonian finite element methods (SHFEM) are a special type of numerical methods
    for numerically approximating the solution of Hamiltonian partial differential
    equations. These methods use Galerkin space-discretizations which result in a
    system of ODEs displaying a discrete version of the Hamiltonian structure of the
    original system. The resulting system of ODEs is then discretized by a symplectic
    time-marching method. This combination results in high-order accurate, fully
    discrete methods which can preserve the invariants of the Hamiltonian defining
    the ODE system. The following figure shows an example with electromagnetics waves propogating in a non-homogeneous medium.
    It shows that our SHFEM method conserves the energy of the semidiscretization in space up to 10 digits of precision,
    and does not allow the exact energy to drift in time. </p>

    <h3> Generalized projection-based analysis of hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods</h4>
    <p> Hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods (HDG)
    lie in between the two most important groups of finite elementtype methods:
    (1) conforming/mixed methods and (2) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods.
    This enables HDG to combine the many advantages from these two groups.
    </p>
    <p>
    Despite the many advantages of HDG methods, their analysis was also separated into two groups: for those more alike mixed methods, they were analyzed similar
    to the classical analysis of mixed methods, by the so-called projection-based analysis; on
    the other hands, for those more alike nonconforming/DG methods, they were analyzed by
    ad-hoc approaches. This separation of analysis has several undesired consequences:
    (1) Those ad-hoc analysis is not as concise and simple as the projection-based analysis,
    (2) Ad-hoc analysis becomes difficult for complicated problems (e.g., time-dependent problems, coupling problems),
    (3) Analysis is hard to reuse because of the separation.
    </p>
    <p>
    To address this issue, we developed the so-called generalized projection-based analysis,
    extending the classical projection-based analysis to those HDG method which do not admit
    M-decomposition (e.g. Lehrenfeld-Schoberl HDG). With these new analysis tools,
    we are able to devise/analyze new HDG methods or improve the analysis of existing ones.
    The applications include time-harmonic and transient
    elastic waves, static and time-dependent Maxwell’s equations and Stokes equations.
